# meross-smartplug-prometheus-exporter
A containarized Python-based exporter that integrates Meross smart plugs with Prometheus for real-time power consumption monitoring. This script connects to the Meross Cloud API to retrieve power metrics from smart plugs and exposes them as Prometheus metrics for easy monitoring and visualization.

To use this project, simply run docker-compose up, which will automatically build the container image and create the container. Please make sure to update your Meross email and password in the <i>docker-compose.yaml</i> file. Additionally, depending on your account, you may need to update the Meross API URL specified in <i>main.py</i>.
